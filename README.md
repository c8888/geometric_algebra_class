# geometric_algebra_class
The program tests several numerical algorithms in Geometric Algebra to solve equation R'(t) = A(t) R(t)  and compares them to conventional method with cross product.
The program needs versor library (http://versor.mat.ucsb.edu/)  placed in the folder versor/ with the source files.
